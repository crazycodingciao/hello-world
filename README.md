# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub-hope it works :)
Hi it's my first day on GitHub and I had a lousy past week because I twisted my ankle and now i can't walk without my crutches. I can't seem to keep my temper in control these few days because I had to struggle with that damn Visual Studio. Still unsuccessful. It's been weeks and I didn't write a single line of code. How frustrating. I feel useless. Hope I can do better with GitHub.
